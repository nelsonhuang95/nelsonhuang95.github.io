I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science, the University of Auckland. My supervisors are [Dr. Meng-Fen Chiang](https://ankechiang.github.io/) and [Dr. Jiamou Liu](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jliu036/). I received the Master of Science degree in computer science (First Class) from the University of Auckland in 2022. During my Master's study, I researched multi-hop logical query reasoning over hierarchical knowledge graphs supervised by Dr. Meng-Fen Chiang and [Prof. Wang-Chien Lee](https://sites.psu.edu/wlee/) (Penn State University). My research interests include:
* Knowledge Graph Representation Learning
* Multi-hop Query Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs
* Natural Language Question Answering
