* Hello, Iâ€™m Zijian!
* I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science, the University of Auckland. My research interests focus on logical query reasoning over knowledge graph and knowledge graph embedding.
* I received the Master of Science degree in computer science (First Class) from the University of Auckland in 2022. During my Master's study, I researched multi-hop logical query reasoning over hierarchical knowledge graphs supervised by [Dr. Meng-Fen Chiang](https://ankechiang.github.io/) and [Prof. Wang-Chien Lee](https://sites.psu.edu/wlee/).
