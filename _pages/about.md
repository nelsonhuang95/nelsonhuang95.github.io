* Hello, Iâ€™m Zijian!
* I am a MSc student at the University of Auckland, majoring in Computer Science. During my Master's study, I researched multi-hop logical query reasoning over hierarchical knowledge graphs supervised by [Dr. Meng-Fen Chiang](https://ankechiang.github.io/) and [Prof. Wang-Chien Lee](https://sites.psu.edu/wlee/).
